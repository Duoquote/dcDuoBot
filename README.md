# DuoBot - Discord Bot

I am making my own Discord bot to use it on my server. May make it publicly accessible when it's done.

- [ ] Add more functions.
- [ ] Add user variable support (Language, prefix etc.).
- [ ] Add database support to record message counts, server config values and etc..
- [ ] Add more info to display with `profile` command.
- [ ] Make a `deluge-console` bridge to use `deluge-console` from my server.
- [ ] Add both Turkish and English explanation of my code and to `README.md` too.
- [ ] Add string input feature in between quotes while parsing command.
