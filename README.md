# DuoBot - Discord Bot

I am making my own Discord bot to use it on my server. May make it publicly accessible when it's done.

### TO-DOs

- [ ] Add more functions.
- [x] ~~Add user variable support~~ (**Language**, ~~prefix~~ etc.).
- [x] ~~Add database support~~ to record **message counts**, ~~server config values~~ and etc..
- [ ] Add more info to display with `profile` command.
- [ ] ~~Make a `deluge-console` bridge to use `deluge-console` from my server.~~ Not quite done yet but I abandoned it because I decided to use heroku to host my bot and it would be unsecure if I were to expose deluge torrent server.
- [ ] Add both Turkish and English explanation of my code and to `README.md` too.
- [x] ~~Track presence data to store in-game time etc~~..
- [ ] **NEW** Will try to add facebook messenger integration to send posts in facebook to discord channels.
